KV arguments in yaml are same as the ones in model docs
the model, scaler and settings have to be saved and serialized
    model class to attach everything
    calling the train func automatically fits the scaler
    calling the predict fund automatically transforms the data through the scaler

    ensemble class to call every submodel
    ALOT of moving parts so manually doing these things will often result in mistakes
